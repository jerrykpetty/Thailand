                Number one on my destinations to travel list would have to be Thailand, next to Brazil. Also known as
                the land of
                smiles, Thailand has a vast environment and deep culture. Great food and beautiful beaches makes for a
                great destination spot for many individuals.

                        Some of my favorite dishes are from the long lineup of thai cusine such as Tom Yum Goong, Gaeng
                        Keow Wan Gai, and Pad Kra Pao. Thai cusine has many different spices and flavors that give it
                        its unique taste. I figured I want to taste the food straight from the source!

                        Thailand is surrounded by lush beautiful forest, filled with many exotic wildlife. Thailand also
                        has some of the prettiest beaches which can be compaed to Brazil and Hawaii.

                        Thailand is known to have one of the best nightlife scenes in the world. Weather you like to
                        party or have a late night stroll, Thailand has something to offer everyone.

                        Siamese which is also known as the Thai language uses a unique writing system called abugidi. I
                        am educating myself on the language as well as the countries customs and rules.
